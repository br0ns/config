          HOW TO BE ANONYMOUS OUT THERE ON THE INTERWEBZ

      ** COMPLETE ALL STEPS BEFORE CONNECTING TO INTERNET **

== Preface
   This document will walk you through setting up a system that you can use
   anonymously.  I'm assuming you will be using Ubuntu Linux for the physical
   machine and VirtualBox for virtualization.  In particular virtual machines
   have IP's in 192.168.56.0/24 and the host has an interface named vboxnet0
   with IP 192.168.56.1.

== Hardware
   Do I even have to tell you to cover you camera and cut the wire to your
   microphone?  Alternatively disable in BIOS.

== Installing Ubuntu using full disk encryption
   Comming...

== Software
   Download the .deb packages for privoxy and tor.  You can get privoxy from
   Ubuntus package repository, and tor from torproject.org.  Don't use the
   Ubuntus tor package!

   Burn the packages to a CD and copy them to your secure machine.  Install both.

== Configuration
   Remember to change IP's and interfaces if you're using something else than
   VirtualBox.

 = privoxy (/etc/privoxy/config)
   1. To handle requests from your virtual machines include
        listen-address 0.0.0.0:8118
      Don't worry about incoming connections as we will block those.
   2. We need privoxy to forward traffic to the tor proxy.  Include
        forward-socks5 / 127.0.0.1:9050

 = tor (/etc/tor/torrc)
   To get tor to accept conncetions from your virtual machines include
     SocksPort 0.0.0.0:9050
   This will make tor complain, but don't worry, we'll block incoming traffic.

 = iptables
   Save the following in a file somewhere (fx. /root/iptables.save):
     *filter
     :INPUT DROP
     :OUTPUT DROP
     :FORWARD DROP
     -A INPUT  -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
     -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
     -A INPUT  -i lo -j ACCEPT
     -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
     -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner debian-tor -j ACCEPT
     -A OUTPUT -o vboxnet0 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
     -A INPUT -i vboxnet0 -p tcp --dport 9050 -j ACCEPT
     -A INPUT -p udp --dport 67:68 --sport 67:68 -j ACCEPT
   Add the following lines to /etc/rc.local:
     /sbin/iptables-restore < /root/iptables.save
     sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

 = ssh (~/.ssh/config)
   NB. You will need to install connect-proxy once your system is bootstrapped.
   Add the following lines:
     Host *
       ProxyCommand /usr/bin/connect-proxy -S 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p

 = Proxy settings
   In Ubuntu go to 'System Settings' and click on 'Network'.  Choose 'Network
   proxy'.  Set 127.0.0.1:8118 as the HTTP proxy and 127.0.0.1:9050 as the SOCKS
   proxy.  Click 'Apply system wide'.

   Your browser might have it's own proxy settings.

 = Virtual machines
   Virtual machines should work out of the box, except their SOCKS proxy should
   be 192.168.56.1:9050 and their HTTP proxy should be 192.168.56.1:8118.

== That's it
   Connect your machine to the internet and go to check.torproject.org to ensure
   that you are secure.

   Then update Ubuntu and install connect-proxy:
     apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get install connect-proxy

== Don't do stupid things
   1. Don't use your usual username.
   2. Don't use your usual password.
   3. Don't check you e-mail/facebook/twitter/what-not.
   4. Don't ever let personal data come in contact with the system.
   5. Don't accumulate browser log.
   6. Don't accumulate chat log.
   ... probably lot's more - don't do stupid things.
